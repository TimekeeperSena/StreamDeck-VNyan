# VNyan Plugin for Stream Deck
A plugin to facilitate controlling the 3D VTuber software VNyan with your Stream Deck

## Configuration
This plugin's core functionality is sending WebSocket messages to VNyan, so **make sure you have the WebSocket server enabled in Settings.**
You'll also want to configure some node graph nodes, so that the WebSocket messages actually do things.

## The advantage
I got a Stream Deck today (14/03/2025). I wasn't satisfied with using WebSocket requests for Stream Deck buttons, so I made this as a real dedicated solution.

- No configuring the WebSocket URL manually (it's built for VNyan so it should Just Workâ„¢)
- Instant response on pressing the button, no delay or lag of any kind
- Many different types of trigger, each good for different things (use momentaries for expressions, for instance)

## Notes
I'm still new to the Stream Deck SDK, so a bunch of this could be improved. The code for this will be improved as time goes on!
